# Survey form with React

This weeks project was to create a survey using React, and introduced me to React State. I decided to make a survey about Autumn habits.

## The problem

As stated above, I used React State for the first time in this project. I read the project brief and watched some videos on what React State is. I also looked to Stack Overflow for answers to some questions I had.

If I had more time I would have designed the range slider and the radio buttons. I would also have added more questions with other types of inputs.
